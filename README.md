# **Installation**

The `XHSSraper` script can be installed using two methods:

- **Using pip**

It is the preferred method for installing it. 

1. **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    
    This creates a virtual environment named `venv` to isolate project dependencies from your system-wide Python installation (**recommended**).
    
2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    
    **Linux/macOS:**
    
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
    **Windows:**
    
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    
3. **Install using pip:**
    
    ```
    pip install XHSScraper
    ```
    
    This will download and install the `XHSScraper` package and its dependencies into your Python environment.
